    <label for="q2">How safe is cosleeping?</label>
    <p>Cosleeping can be scary for parents to try out because of the danger of SIDs, or Sudden Infant Deaths. However, FeatherPad aims to relieve those anxieties by providing a comfy surface for your baby to sleep on while keeping track of your baby’s surroundings to ensure the safety of your child.
