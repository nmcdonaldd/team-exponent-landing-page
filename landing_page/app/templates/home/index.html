    <button class ='message'>Why FeatherPad?</button>
    <p class = 'message_content'>Co-sleeping is defined as the practice of a parent sleeping in the same bed as their infant child. This
      can prove beneficial in the baby's upbringing and offer a close connection between the baby and parent.
      Yet many co-sleepers today tend to be obtrusive and put barriers between the baby and the parent.
      FeatherPad aims to deliver a non-intrusive, yet safe product that will fulfill your desire to have a
      nurturing relationship with your baby even while you sleep!</p>
